# Archived
I have decided to archive this repository and not maintain it. E-surge used my application as a stepping stone, and his [re-mixed](https://github.com/ESurge/flipperzero-firmware-unirfremix) version is much better. It has a better layout and error handling. 

## Historical Content
Right now, this only works with the RAW capture format, so KeeLoq/Kia/Came..etc wont work. That is in the backlog.

Make sure to copy the [assets/resources/subghz/assets/universal_rf_map](/assets/resources/subghz/assets/universal_rf_map) after editing it to the sd /subghz/assets/universal_rf_map.
